# keycloaktalk
Tech talk for a basic Keycloak demo. Lab steps are located at https://github.com/joshuacanter/keycloaktalk/wiki.

The themes folder contains a completed theme as discussed in http://github.com/joshuacanter/keycloaktalk/wiki/Themes. 

The folder jboss-helloworld-rs is the helloworld-rs project provided as an example in JBoss Developer Studio.  

The folder jboss-helloworld-rs-solution contains the solution to the https://github.com/joshuacanter/keycloaktalk/wiki/Simple-Rest-Client lab, however, you still have to update the keycloak.json file with your own.
